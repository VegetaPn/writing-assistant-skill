# Writing Assistant

A complete end-to-end writing workflow that transforms ideas, materials, or rough drafts into polished, illustrated articles ready for publication.

## Overview

This skill orchestrates a multi-step writing process:
1. Collect initial content (topic, materials, or draft)
2. Clarify and enrich through interactive questioning
3. Generate or refine the initial draft
4. Polish the content using content-research-writer
5. Add appropriate illustrations using baoyu-xhs-images
6. Combine content and images into final article
7. Optionally publish to WeChat or X platforms

## Workflow

### Initial Setup: Check Dependencies

Before starting the workflow, verify that all required skills are installed.

**Required dependencies:**
- `content-research-writer` - For polishing content (Step 4)
- `baoyu-xhs-images` - For generating illustrations (Step 5)

**Optional dependencies:**
- `baoyu-post-to-wechat` - For WeChat publishing (Step 8)
- `baoyu-post-to-x` OR `x-article-publisher` - For X/Twitter publishing (Step 8)

**Dependency check process:**

This skill bundles all dependencies in the `dependencies/` directory for convenient automatic installation.

1. **Check installed skills** using:
   ```bash
   claude skill list
   ```

2. **Identify missing dependencies**:
   - Compare installed skills against the required and optional dependencies listed above
   - Note which dependencies are missing

3. **For each missing dependency**:
   - Check if bundled version exists in `dependencies/<skill-name>/`
   - If found, ask user: "The skill `<skill-name>` is required for [purpose]. Install it to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory?"
   - If user confirms, copy to project:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p .claude/skills
     cp -r dependencies/<skill-name> .claude/skills/
     ```
   - Verify the skill is now available

4. **Handle installation outcomes**:
   - **Required dependencies missing and user declines**: Explain that workflow cannot proceed without these skills. Offer to pause until user installs them manually.
   - **Optional dependencies missing**: Note that publishing features (Step 8) will be unavailable. Continue with the workflow.
   - **Installation failed**: Provide manual instructions:
     ```bash
     # Manual installation from bundled dependencies
     cp -r dependencies/content-research-writer .claude/skills/
     cp -r dependencies/baoyu-xhs-images .claude/skills/
     ```

5. **Proceed to Step 1** once required dependencies are installed

### Step 1: Choose Starting Mode

Ask the user to select one of three modes:

**Mode 1: Topic-Based**
- User provides a topic or theme they want to write about
- Most suitable when starting from scratch with just an idea

**Mode 2: Materials-Based**
- User provides loosely organized materials, notes, or reference content
- Can include rough notes, copied references, or miscellaneous content
- Ask for file paths if materials are in files

**Mode 3: Draft-Based**
- User provides an unpolished initial draft
- Suitable when the user has already written a rough version
- Ask for file path if draft is in a file

### Step 2: Collect and Clarify (Modes 1 & 2 Only)

For Modes 1 and 2, use an interactive questioning approach:

1. **Analyze the provided content first**:
   - Read and understand what the user has already provided
   - Identify what's clear vs. what needs clarification
   - Note gaps, ambiguities, or areas that need expansion

2. **Ask tailored, content-specific questions**:
   - Formulate questions based on the specific topic and materials provided
   - Focus on filling identified gaps and resolving ambiguities
   - Ask about aspects that are unclear or need deeper exploration
   - Adapt questions to the user's context and writing goals

3. **Collect user responses** systematically

4. **Supplement with research** if context is insufficient:
   - Use WebSearch for relevant information
   - Use WebFetch if user provides URLs
   - Gather supporting materials from the internet

5. **Organize into initial draft** based on:
   - User's answers to questions
   - Researched supplementary materials
   - Logical article structure

6. **Proceed to Step 4** after creating the initial draft

**Question Strategy:**
- Ask 2-4 questions at a time (avoid overwhelming the user)
- Tailor each question to the specific content provided - no fixed templates
- Common areas to explore (adjust based on actual needs):
  - What's the main message or takeaway?
  - Who is the target audience?
  - What's the desired tone (professional, casual, technical, etc.)?
  - Are there specific points that need more detail?
  - What context or background should readers have?
  - Are there particular examples or stories to include?
- Let the content guide the questions - if something is already clear, don't ask about it

### Step 3: Process Draft (Mode 3 Only)

For Mode 3, skip directly to Step 4 with the user's provided draft.

### Step 4: Polish the Draft

Use the **@content-research-writer** skill to refine and polish the draft:

```
Invoke: content-research-writer skill
Input: The initial or user-provided draft
Output: {filename}-polished.md
```

The polished version will have:
- Improved structure and flow
- Better hooks and engagement
- Citations and research integration
- Professional writing quality

### Step 5: Generate Illustrations

Use the **@baoyu-xhs-images** skill to create appropriate images:

```
Invoke: baoyu-xhs-images skill
Input: {filename}-polished.md content
Output: Generated images
```

**Image Guidelines:**
- Images should be appropriately spaced (not too dense, usually 3~5 images)
- Select key points that benefit from visual illustration
- Maintain balance between text and visuals

### Step 6: Create Final Article

Combine the polished content with generated images:

1. Take the {filename}-polished.md content
2. Insert images at appropriate positions
3. Ensure proper formatting and layout
4. Create final output: {filename}-final.md

**Layout Considerations:**
- Place images near relevant text sections
- Maintain readable flow
- Use consistent formatting
- Ensure images enhance rather than disrupt reading

### Step 7: Next Steps

After creating the final article, summarize the work completed and ask the user about publication:

**Do not write a summary document**. Instead, provide a brief verbal summary and ask:
- "Would you like to publish this article?"
- "Which platform would you prefer: WeChat Official Account (微信公众号) or X (Twitter)?"
- "Or would you like to make any revisions first?"

### Step 8: Publish (Optional)

If the user wants to publish, invoke the appropriate skill:

**For WeChat Official Account:**
```
Invoke: baoyu-post-to-wechat skill
Input: {filename}-final.md and images
```

**For X (Twitter):**
```
Invoke: baoyu-post-to-x or x-article-publisher skill
Input: {filename}-final.md and images
```

Follow the publishing skill's workflow for platform-specific requirements.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Patient with Questions**: Take time in Step 2 to thoroughly understand the user's vision
2. **Research Thoughtfully**: Supplement user input with credible sources when gaps exist
3. **Preserve User Voice**: While polishing, maintain the user's intended tone and style
4. **Image Selection**: Be selective with images - quality and relevance over quantity
5. **Review Before Publishing**: Confirm the user is satisfied with the final article before publishing

## File Naming Convention

Use consistent naming throughout the workflow:
- Initial draft: `{topic-or-title}.md`
- Polished version: `{topic-or-title}-polished.md`
- Final version: `{topic-or-title}-final.md`
